In the following segment, the uploaded codes can train and detect the body parts of a human being fairly to be said this is a trial model hence, only targeted to detect parts such
as Hand, Face and Leg.

In order to use the code, one might need to download the dataset namely the 3 rar files.

Create a folder named as Body_parts and extract all three files in the newly created folder (Body_parts)

After that in the code section of Body_part_detection, change the path.......as highlighted with a comment in the code itself.

Run the code and it is good to go
